## 4. Running the Microservice

### 4.1. Prerequisites

* **Required Tools**
    * **Maven:** For building the microservice without Docker.
    * **Docker:** For building the project with an image and container.
    * **Java:** For interpreting the language in which the microservice is developed.

### 4.1.1 Maven

* **Recommendations**
    * **Version:** Have Maven version 3.9.9 installed (recommended)

### 4.1.2 Docker

* **Recommendations**
    * **Version:** Have __Docker version 27.5.1__ installed (recommended)

### 4.1.3 Java

* **Recommendations**
    * **Version:** Have __Java 21.0.5__ installed (recommended)

### 4.2. Building the Microservice Without Docker

* **Description:** To build the microservice from the project root.
  * **Command:**

      ~~~
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * The command generates the necessary artifacts for service execution and to run the microservice without docker you need to have the other tools installed, such as Java and Maven.

### 4.3. Building the Microservice With Docker 

* **Description:** To build the image with Docker you have to run the following command
  * **Command:**

    ~~~
    docker build -t ms-price-reader .
    ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * This command must be executed in the directory where the __Dockerfile__ is located

### 4.3.1 Run the container

* **Description:** To run the container with the image we created previously you must run the following command
  * **Command:**

    ~~~
     docker run -p 8080:8080 --name price-service ms-price-reader
    ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * This command must be executed in the directory where the __Dockerfile__ is located
    * This command will also let you see the logs at runtime to know what happens inside the microservice with each request launched.

### 4.3.2 View logs at runtime

* **Description:** In case you have exited the terminal where you are viewing the microservice logs you can re-enter to view them with the following command
  * **Command:**

    ~~~
     docker logs -f price-service
    ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * This command must be executed in the directory where the __Dockerfile__ is located
    * This command will let you see all the logs at runtime to know what happens inside the microservice with each request launched.


### 4.3.3 Pause the created container

* **Description:** If you have finished performing the relevant tests or finished using the microservice you can pause the container with the following command
  * **Command:**

    ~~~
     docker stop price-service 
    ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * This command must be executed in the directory where the __Dockerfile__ is located
    * This command will pause the container we created previously called __price-service__.

### 4.3.4 Delete the created container

* **Description:** If you have finished performing the relevant tests or finished using the microservice you can delete the container with the following command
  * **Command:**

    ~~~
     docker rm price-service  
    ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * This command must be executed in the directory where the __Dockerfile__ is located
    * This command will delete the container we created previously called __price-service__.
    * This command must be executed after having paused the container called __price-service__.

### 4.3.5 Delete the created image

* **Description:** If you have finished performing the relevant tests or finished using the microservice you can delete the image with the following command
  * **Command:**

    ~~~
     docker rmi ms-price-reader 
    ~~~

* **Observations:**
    * This command must be executed in the directory where the __Dockerfile__ is located

    * This command must be executed after having deleted the container called __price-service__.

### 5. API Testing

* **Unit Tests:**
    * You can run the unit tests created for the entire microservice with the following command
      * **Command:**

        ~~~
         mvn clean test 
        ~~~
        
    * You can run the unit tests created for the entire microservice from the executor of the tool in which you compile the project you can do the following
    * Example
      * ![img.png](images/testUnits.png)


* **Postman:**
    * You can access the Postman collection by opening the folder that is in the root of this project called __collection__:
      * ![img.png](images/collection.png)
      * You import the collection into postman and you can use it.
    * Inside the collection you will have the 5 selected test cases to test from the tool
      * ![img.png](images/postmanTest.png)


* **Swagger:**
    * Once the microservice is up with or without Docker, go to the following URL from your browser to see the documentation with Swagger-UI:

    ~~~
    http://localhost:8080/price/v1/swagger-ui/index.html 
    ~~~

    * Here you can see all the documentation about the endpoints, request, response objects, headers or parameters. This documentation is with springdoc so you will see the description of all the fields or objects that they are, what they are for or examples of data you can send
    * Here you can modify the data as you wish to verify the functionality or fetch different information from the database
    * You can also see the yml generated by spring doc from the folder located in the root of this project called __api-contracts__
